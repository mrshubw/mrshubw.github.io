I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2021, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Cyberspace Security at UCAS. My research focuses on Differential Privacy and Obliviousness, areas where I aim to contribute to the advancement of secure and private systems. Always eager to explore new challenges in cybersecurity, I am passionate about applying cutting-edge techniques to protect user data.
